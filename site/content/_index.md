    We're Friends of People with Disabilities, a charity based in Kampala,
    Uganda which cares for children with disabilities.


    There is a stigma around disability in Uganda, with many disabled children
    being neglected by their families.


    Friends of People with Disabilities provides a safe and nurturing
    environment for children with disabilities, providing them with education
    and healthcare.


    We care for 20 children with disabilities such as autism, Down syndrome,
    cerebral palsy, epilepsy, sickle cell anemia, deafness, attention deficit
    disorder and general learning difficulties.
