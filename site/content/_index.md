    We're Friends of People with Disabilities, a charity based in Kampala,
    Uganda which cares for children with disabilities.


    There is a stigma around disability in Uganda, with many disabled children
    being neglected by their families.


    Friends of People with Disabilities provides a safe and nurturing
    environment for children with disabilities, providing them with education
    and healthcare.
